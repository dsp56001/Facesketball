*UpdateFrameInterval sets how often the game samples the camera
	
Keys
1 turn on face deaction
2 turn on motion detection

V draw video will slow that game down 
A changes face dection to acurate and slow
F toggle face detection find eyes
S Scale Video
[ change camera sampleing interval up
] change camera sampling interval down
	

Multiplayer game
join to network game?
master machine?
I'd like the physics objects to move between screens
All game clients send sound events to a master machine?

Screen Masks
tool to mask out an area of the screen rectangles should be fine

Sound 
think about multiplayer sound? single sound machine? maybe the server amchine?

Graphics
get some ideas for graphics. 
We need physics objects
We need a particle system to view the motions on the motion detector.
Face Controllers and a Particle system

Motion Detection
Make it faster it's better but I think we need separate time for the face detector and the motions detector
Use the summed vector to infulenct the physics objects (kinda like wind) it migh tbe nice to use particle effects here

FaceDetector
Alow Multiple faces? I set it to find first face so right now it only detects one it's nice and fast this way
Face Chases detected face istead of moving to the exact face location

Camera
Control size 320 x 240 is way faster
Right now it uses the camera default and the dimensions are hard coded TODO fix hard coded dimensions
Explore camera tweaks using statements and posible adjusting the frame rate
